error: #[live_prop_test] can only be applied to a fn item, impl item, or trait item
       
         = help: if it looks like it's already applied to one of those things, maybe there's a syntax error in the body? live_prop_test can only recognize what it is if it's syntactically valid.
         = help: try commenting out the #[live_prop_test] attribute to make it easier to find the syntax error.
